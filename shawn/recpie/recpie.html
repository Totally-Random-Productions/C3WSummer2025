    <h2>What Is Indian Chicken Curry?</h2>

    <p>    You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated Indian chicken curry recipe:
Saute a diced onion in olive oil until lightly browned. Stir in the seasonings (garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, paprika, bay leaf, ginger, sugar and salt). Add the chicken pieces, tomato paste, yogurt, and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and stir in the lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
