        For years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. Anytime I made homemade
        brownies, I wanted them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, with crispy
        edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. We always made them from a
        box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate
        brownies of my childhood.
    </p>

    <p>
        So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle Lopez’s new book Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix
        Brownies,
        From Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade brownies that would be just as delicious as
        the ones from a box?
    </p>

    <p>
        The verdict: yes! I’ve had this brownie recipe on repeat since the first time I tried it. It calls for basic
        pantry ingredients, and it’s hardly more difficult than using a mix. As for the brownies, they’re true
        perfection – glossy, fudgy, and filled with rich chocolate flavor. Trust me, you’re going to want to make them
        ASAP!

        </u>
    </h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>8x8 Baking Dish (this is the one I use so they don't overcook)</li>
        <li>Cooking Spray (I love this avocado oil one from Chosen Foods)</li>
        <li>Parchment Paper (this makes it so much easier to remove the brownies from the pan)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <u>
            <i>Ingredients</i>
        </u>
    </h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar*</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil**</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
        <u>
            <i>Instructions</i>
        </u>
    </h3>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish
            <b>(not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook)</b>
            with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake
            for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to
            pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).
            <b>Cool completely before slicing.***</b>
            Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!
        </li>
    </ol>

        <u>
            <i>Notes</i>
        </u>
    </h3>

    <span>*If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>**I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with chocolate. Keep
    in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>***When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool completely,
    about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to firm up the longer
    they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.</span>
