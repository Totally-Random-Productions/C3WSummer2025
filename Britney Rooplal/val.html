    Now I'd like to just start by saying of course, I am aware that the assignment given was to make an advertisement based on
    media you love. However, while I do enjoy Valorant
    <del>somewhat</del>
    I did want to take another spin on this as I do have a bit of a love-hate relationship with this game, as many
    players do.
    <del>(Also,
    <b>very important information here,</b>
     unfortntately, I had no ideas on how exactly to make an advertisement with the knowledge I have so far)</del>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Agents and the Game itself</h3>
            The game itself invloves using what is called utilty which are determined by the agent you choose to use.
            These
            character are placed in one of four categories. These cataegories include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Duelists:</b> To put it quite simply, their entire job is to find people and kill them
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Controllers:</b> Now this one is really confusing to me as well, but essentially, these guys are
                    responsible for basically creating the battle ground, by throwing smokes (hence why they are
                    commonly referred to as "smokers"), walls, among other utility depending on the agent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Initiators:</b> These guys can make or break the team's chances of winning. They're like the
                    midfielders of the a football team, they're both passive and aggressive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sentinels:</b> These agents are known as defensive strongholds. Their role is very passive, and
                    requires immense patience. They are responsible for ensuring the enemy team does not gain space.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <i>So why am I giving you all this information?</i> Well despite all of these roles, just like in a football
            match, particularly one where the teams are inexperienced, if a player does not know how to properly use an
            agent and the agents utility, they risk dying not because they have bad mechanics such as aiming etc, but
            simply because of balancing those mechanics with all of this utiltity.
            <br>
            <br>
            For players who are coming from games such as Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, or any other shooter game of
            that sort, it might be a lot to process as you can die due to utility even if it was placed by a terrible
            player. On the other hand though, because Valorant is one of the first shooter game I've played, not only do
            I have to learn mechanics, but also how to use utility, understand maps and which agents to utilise. There
            are
            <b>many...many</b>
            aspects of the game which must be learnt, and if you haven't played shooters before, I believe the mindset
            you get from playing this game can be beneficial in any game. Whether on defense or attack you learn to
            build confidence in fighting

            <h3>Valorant Gamers</h3>
            Lots of games like these are known to have what the gaming community calls "toxic players". Often times,
            this toxicity will be directed towards female gamers, particularly those who may not be as skilled at the
            game. Now this is something that is an ongoing problem and will continue to be a problem. Nevertheless,
            there can be no light without darkness. Therefore, it is honestly one of the best feelings when you join a
            game, and your team mates are nothing but kind to you. As a player who hasn't been able to put as much
            effort as I'd like to into the game, meeting these players not only
            <i>"restore my faith in humanity"</i>
            as we say, but it also encourages me to get better. Being new in environment is hard as it is, having
            support from complete strangers even for the a few minutes, to me is a beautiful thing, and it's something I
            love about this game.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's not only in game that we can bond in that way. Outside of valorant, when meeting players, a lot of the
            time gamers are not the most extroverted hence why, games like these are a great way to bond with people in any situation.
            Valorant to me is not just a game, it's a community of people who, can talk about any and everything
            including contantly screaming
            <i>"Why do i play this game!"</i>
