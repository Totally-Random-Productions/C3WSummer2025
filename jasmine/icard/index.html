              This is my future cat, Renly McGlashin. He'll fit right in with the family. Even though he looks mean, that's just a formality. He's just Jamaican. He'll be a emotional support animal by being the visual indicator of the disdain I have for the 9-5 corporate lifestyle. Hopefully he likes curry chicken and medium rare steak. I'd love to carry you on mountain peaks hikes, river swimming. Probably we could watch a movie if you stay still. I dont know, I heard youre breed is difficult to keep clean. I dont think that should be a problem though becuase youre strictly a domestic cat and Im not ready to be a grandmother to 12 kids. We're gonna play all day and all night except for when I;m asleep or when i'm at work. It doesn't matter though, we're gonna be best of pals.
