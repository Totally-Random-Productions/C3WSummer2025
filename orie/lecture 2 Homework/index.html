    <h1>Why the Super Nintendo Is My Favorite Gaming System</h1>
    <p>When it comes to gaming, few systems have had as lasting an impact on me as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). 
        While modern consoles boast stunning graphics and vast open worlds, the SNES holds a special place in my heartâ€”not just for its nostalgia, but for its timeless quality, iconic library, 
        and the sheer joy it brought (and still brings) every time I play a game (emulation)</p>

        <h2>A Golden Era of Game Design</h2>
        <p>
            The Super Nintendo was released during what many consider the golden age of video game design. 
            Developers had to work within technical limitations, and because of that, they focused on making
            games that were tight, polished, and fun. The gameplay had to shine because there were no flashy
            graphics to hide behind. And shine it did with titles like 
            <ul>
                <li><b>Super Mario World</b></li>
                <li><b>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</b></li>
                <li><b>Donkey Kong Country</b></li>
            </ul>
