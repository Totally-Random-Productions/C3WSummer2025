    <p>Bahamian conch salad is a vibrant and crunchy salad made using raw pound conch meat. The flavor is made up of a mixture of onions, bell peppers, orange juice, lime juice, and spicy peppers giving it a fresh, zesty, and slightly spicy taste.

The dish is a Bahamian staple, so if you want to know what it is like to eat like a local, it is the perfect place to start.

Conch meat is a good source of protein, meaning that although this tropical conch salad feels like a light bite, it will give you all the fuel you need.</p>

<h3>Instructions!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by preparing the conch. First, soak it in water and lemon juice for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><p>While the conch is soaking, you can chop up your garlic, cucumber, tomatoes, onion, and bell pepper. I like using a dicer to do this because it’s much easier than using a knife! The dicer also creates equal-sized pieces, which is an integral part of the texture of tropical conch salad.</p></li>
    <li>Once it’s finished soaking, wash it thoroughly to remove any debris, slime, or black pieces..</li>
    <li><p>Cover the conch meat with plastic wrap on a large, clean work surface and use a meat tenderizer to pound it so that it becomes thin. I like this meat mallet because it’s lightweight, and it has both a textured and a smooth side to tenderize the meat and smooth it out as needed.</p></li>
    <li>Once you’ve tenderized the conch, using a sharp knife, chop it into bite-sized pieces. Try to get the pieces as uniform as possible, as uniform pieces will combine better with the veggies.</li>
    <li><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the onions, lime juice, orange juice, bell pepper, tomatoes, onion, cucumber, and the conch meat. It’s essential that you use a nonreactive mixing bowl so that the taste of your salad isn’t affected.</p></li>
    <li>Serve chilled as a refreshing appetizer or light meal.</li>
