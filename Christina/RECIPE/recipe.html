    <p>Nothing is quite as peachy as this easy-peasy peach crumble. Who among us would ever turn down a fruit-packed, streusel-topped dessert warm from the oven? A big scoop of vanilla ice cream alongside is, of course, non-negotiable.</p>

    <p>Different from a cobbler, which is made with a fluffy, biscuit-like topping, a peach crumble is topped with a streusel crumb made from flour, sugar, melted butter, and a little cinnamon. It’s that sweet, buttery, crisp texture that pairs so perfectly with the soft baked peaches underneath. Don't get us wrong, we love a good cobbler. But you'll find this peach crumble at the very top of our summer baking list.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Peach Crumble vs. Peach Cobbler</h2>

    <p>If asked to choose between crumble and cobbler, it's certainly hard to pick a favorite. Cobblers feature a cakey, biscuit-like topping, dolloped over fruit and baked until golden. The topping soaks up a bit of the juice from the fruit, for a tender, fruit-forward result that goes down easy.</p>

    <p>Crumbles (and crisps) are a bit different. The same tender fruit filling is baked until bubbly, but topped with a crumbly, golden brown topping that's almost the texture of a crisp granola or cookie. This topping provides a nice textural contrast to the richness of the gooey fruit filling, and can also impart its own flavor to the mix, with possible additions of oats, brown sugar, nuts, or spices. Overall, crumbles and cobblers are both delicious in their own way, but each is unique.</p>

<h2>How To Make Peach Crumble</h2>

<p>Simply toss the peach filling to combine, then spoon into a pie plate and top with a quick and easy crumble topping. This dessert couldn't be easier, or more satisfying, especially when served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Full instructions are below, but here's a brief recap before you get started:</p>

<ol>
    <li> 
        <p>Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 375°F.
    <li>
        <p></p></li></p>
    </li>
Step 3. Make crumb topping: Whisk to combine dry ingredients in a medium bowl. Add melted butter, and stir until mixture is crumbly.
Step 4. Add crumb topping to fruit: Spoon over peaches.
Step 5. Bake: Place pie plate onto a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden brown and bubbling. Cool slightly and serve with ice cream.
