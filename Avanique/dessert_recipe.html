    <p>Hello from the coffee shop! Iâ€™m currently sitting here in Hamburg, sipping a macchiato, and eating the most incredibly delicious almond croissant. Not bad for a Fridayâ€¦ not bad at all ðŸ˜‰ Howâ€™s your morning so far? Any exciting weekend plans?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>When I was in my early 20â€™s I spent a few years working at The Cheesecake Factory. It was a really fun, high paced job, and it quickly developed me into a (self-proclaimed) cheesecake connoisseur. I should probably note I didnâ€™t work in the bakery â€“ or gain access to any top secret recipes (I wish!) â€“ but still, my time spent there definitely helped spark my intense love affair with creamy cheesecake.</p>

    <h1>RECIPE ðŸ˜‰</h2>
    <h2><i>Ingredients</i></h2>

    <h3>Oreo Crust Essentials</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 Oreo Cookies</li>
        <li>1/4 cup  unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>White Chocolate Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 bricks (24 ounces) full-fat cream cheese, VERY soft</li>
        <li>1 cup (8 ounces) full fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 large eggs + 2 egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>8 ounces white chocolate, chopped, melted and slightly cooled</li>
    </ul>
<h2><i>Instructions</i></h2>
<h3>Prepare the pan</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees (F). Wrap a 9" springform pan VERY well in multiple layers of heavy-duty tin foil; lightly grease the pan with non-stick spray, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Beat the softened cream cheese and sour cream in a blender until completely smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the container as needed. You want this mixture completely smooth before adding anymore ingredients! </li>
    <li>Add in the eggs, egg yolks, and sugar and pulse until combined. Add in the vanilla and pulse for another 10 seconds. Don't over mix!</li>
    <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold in the lemon juice, then fold in the melted white chocolate.</li>
    <li>Pour the filling into the prepared crust, spread evenly, and smooth the top with a rubber spatula.</li>
    <li>Top with the raspberry swirl.</li>
    <li>Place the springform pan into a large baking pan (with high sides) and fill the pan halfway with hot water; this is your water bath (see post if you need more information on this).</li>
</ol>
