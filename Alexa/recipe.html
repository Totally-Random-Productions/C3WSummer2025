     <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
            <p>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>

            <p>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>
