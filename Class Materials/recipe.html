    <p>
        Jerk chicken is Jamaican street food, but jerk has evolved over the years to mean so much more to Jamaica’s heritage. In the tourist towns of Jamaica, practically every menu will have at least one jerk dish. Commercializing jerk in this way is a departure from its humble roots as it is not something most Jamaicans even cook at home. Jerk originated in the cool hills of Portland by the Maroons, Jamaica’s runaway slaves. Authentic jerk food has unique spicing, but also a unique cooking method. It is still debatable that jerk cannot be made at home in an oven and must be done over an open fire of coals and pimento wood for it to truly be considered jerk.

        Commercializing jerk meant giving everyday people, and especially Jamaicans in the diaspora, a chance to still enjoy the flavors of jerk at home. Companies like Walkerswood and Grace have bottled versions of pretty decent jerk marinades that are great substitutes when you want to re-create jerk outside of the traditional jerk found on the island. The evolution of jerk also meant an evolution of the flavors. In the beginning, jerk spicing was only used on wild hogs and included wild cinnamon and nutmeg in the ingredient list. In this recipe, I have skipped the cinnamon and nutmeg for a more spicy, savory and pungent jerk flavor.

        <li>1/4 cup whole allspice berries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon gravy master or Grace browning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                 Prepare the following, placing each in a blender as you complete it: Trim and coarsely chop 5 medium scallions and 1/2 medium yellow onion. Peel 5 garlic cloves. Peel and finely grate 1 (2-inch piece) ginger until you have 1 tablespoon.
            </p>
          
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 10 fresh thyme sprigs (including stems), 2 whole scotch bonnet peppers, 1/4 cup whole allspice berries, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons all-purpose seasoning, 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon gravy master or Grace browning, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons onion powder, and 2 teaspoons smoked paprika. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pat 6 whole chicken legs dry with paper towels. Use the tip of a knife to make a few short slits about 1/2-inch deep on both sides of each leg, keeping the skin in one piece and not cutting all the way through to the bone. Add to the marinade and massage the marinade into the chicken with your hands, getting some it into the slits. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.
