  <h1><u>Glorbaxian Slime Pods</u></h1>
<p>
  <i>A truly delectable treat, famous on planet Xylar for its unique texture and zesty, bio-luminescent glow. A favorite among young Glorbaxians!</i>
</p>

<h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>One dozen freshly harvested Flar-Flar eggs</li>
  <li>A single, pulsating Nebula Nodule</li>
  <li>Three cups of dehydrated Martian moon-dust</li>
  <li>A splash of Venusian swamp gas (for flavor)</li>
  <li>A pinch of crystallized asteroid salt</li>
  <li>Gaseous Glimmer Worms (for garnish)</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gently crack the <b>Flar-Flar eggs</b> into a non-reactive silicon bowl. The yolks should be a shimmering, iridescent color. If they are merely glowing, they are over-ripe.</li>
  <li>Carefully dice the <u>Nebula Nodule</u>. <b>BE WARNED:</b> It will attempt to phase in and out of this dimension. Use a temporal-stasis field to keep it stable.</li>
  <li>Whisk the diced nodule into the eggs. The mixture should begin to hum at a low frequency.</li>
  <li>Slowly fold in the dehydrated <b>moon-dust</b>. The mixture will thicken and begin to form semi-sentient pods. Do not be alarmed by their soft cooing noises.</li>
  <li>Just before serving, introduce the <i>Venusian swamp gas</i>. This will activate the bio-luminescence.</li>
  <li>Arrange the pods on a platter and sprinkle with asteroid salt.</li>
</ol>

<h3><i>Serving Suggestion</i></h3>
<p>
  For a truly authentic experience, release the <u>Gaseous Glimmer Worms</u> just above the platter and allow them to float down onto the pods. Serve immediately. Best enjoyed in a zero-gravity environment.
